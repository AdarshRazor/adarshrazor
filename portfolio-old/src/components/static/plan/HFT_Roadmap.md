## 2025 (Next 6–12 Months): Build Foundations

* **Deepen C++ and Systems Skills:** Complete an advanced C++ course or book (e.g. *“Effective Modern C++”*). Practice writing performance-critical code. Study operating systems and networking (consider MIT’s OCW *Computer Systems Engineering* lectures or similar).
* **Algorithm & DS Practice:** Solve daily problems on Codeforces or HackerRank to master data structures and algorithms. Track progress on GitHub (link solutions to portfolio). Participate in at least one coding contest per month.
* **Mathematics Review:** Take online courses (Coursera/edX) on probability, statistics, and linear algebra. Implement statistical models or small Monte Carlo simulations in Python or C++.
* **Project – Basic Trading System:** Start a hands-on project simulating an exchange. For example, implement an **order-matching engine**: a C++ program that ingests buy/sell orders (market/limit) and maintains an order book. Extend it with a simple **FIX-like TCP interface** (single-threaded to start). This demonstrates understanding of exchange protocols and networking.
* **Project – Networking & Low-Latency Demo:** Build a toy **TCP load balancer** in C++ or Go. For instance, write a multithreaded server that distributes incoming trade-order messages to worker threads. Measure latency and optimize (avoid locks, use lock-free queues). Document this project on GitHub.
* **Competitive Programming:** Reach \~InterviewBit/LeetCode gold level. Completing “Cracking the Coding Interview” exercises can help organize practice.
* **Certification/Education:** If not done, consider a short certificate (e.g. *Coursera* specialization in C++ or systems programming). Aim to complete one in 2025.
* **Networking:** Join HFT/quant forums and LinkedIn groups. Begin following quant influencers (e.g. HFT engineers on Twitter/LinkedIn) for insights. Attend a virtual quant meet-up or HFT webinar.
* **Resume/LinkedIn Update:** Update GitHub portfolio and resume to highlight new projects (e.g. order book engine, load balancer). Emphasize any C++ work, competitive programming rank, and relevant coursework.

## 2026: Advanced Projects & Applications

* **Complex System Projects:** Expand your projects to simulate more realistic trading workflows. Examples:

  * Implement a **market-data feed handler**: a C++ service consuming simulated streaming quotes (UDP/multicast) and updating your order book in real-time.
  * Build a **multithreaded matching engine**: evolve the engine to handle thousands of orders per second, using lock-free data structures or memory pooling to minimize latency.
  * Create a simple **statistical arbitrage backtester**: in Python or C++, use historical price data to test a mean-reversion or momentum strategy. (This shows quant strategy understanding.)
* **Competitive Programming & Open Source:** Continue contest participation, aiming for national/international rankings. Contribute to open-source quant libraries or algorithmic-trading projects to demonstrate collaboration.
* **Core CS Mastery:** Study advanced topics like cache-locality (read about CPU caching and false sharing), Linux kernel network stack (e.g. how epoll works), and real-time OS optimizations (e.g. using `mmap`, DPDK, kernel bypass techniques).
* **Finance & Math:** Read a basic book on financial derivatives (e.g. Hull’s *Options, Futures, & Other Derivatives*) to understand instruments often traded by quants. Study stochastic calculus only if interested in deeper research roles.
* **Certifications:** Optional – begin **CFA Level I** or **FRM Part I** if targeting hedge fund credibility in the long run (can be done by self-study in parallel).
* **Networking & Applications:** With a stronger portfolio, start applying to internships or entry-level roles by mid-2026. Target **Quantitative Developer** or **Software Engineer (Trading Systems)** positions at HFT firms. Use job boards and company career pages. Leverage LinkedIn: connect with recruiters at Tower, DE Shaw India, WorldQuant, Optiver, etc.
* **Interview Prep:** Practice technical interviews focusing on systems design (e.g. designing a messaging queue or realtime service), DSA, and multi-threading. Platforms like TechMock or interviewbit can help simulate quant coding interviews.
* **Resume Enhancement:** Highlight any published coding contest achievements or contributions. Emphasize relevant school projects (if any prior) and new quant projects on your portfolio site.

## 2027: Enter the Industry / Advanced Education

* **Secure a Role:** Ideally, by 2027 Adarsh should land a full-time position as a Quantitative Developer, Low-Latency Software Engineer, or a similar role in an algorithmic trading team. In this role, focus on real-world HFT problems: optimizing execution, reducing latencies, and collaborating with traders/researchers. Build on-the-job skills in C++ optimization, Linux tuning, and distributed systems.
* **If Not Hired, Consider a Master’s:** If industry entry is delayed, apply to top **MFE/MS Programs** (e.g. Carnegie Mellon, Columbia MFE, Illinois-TAMID, or Indian programs like IIM Calcutta MFin) for fall 2027 or 2028. A graduate degree in financial engineering or quantitative finance provides formal education and recruitment pipelines for hedge funds.
* **Advanced Learning on Job:** Continue self-learning. Topics like advanced C++ (template metaprogramming, advanced STL), GPU programming (CUDA) or FPGAs (if interested) can set you apart. Also learn market data protocols (ITCH/OUCH) if your firm uses them.
* **Strategic Projects:** At work or in free time, prototype a **simple automated trading strategy** on paper. For example, code a momentum strategy on crypto (easy APIs available) or stocks, focusing on signal generation and execution logic. Even a backtested Python notebook shows initiative.
* **Networking:** Develop connections inside your firm and at industry events. Consider enrolling in programs like Jane Street’s *INSIGHT* (if available) or Two Sigma’s *New Seekers Summit*. Engage on forums like Quant StackExchange, quant Twitter, or local quant meetups.
* **Professional Profile:** Update resume with the new role and projects. If working, get mentoring or feedback from seniors to shape your growth path (e.g. aiming for strategy development).

## 2028–2029: Career Growth & Hedge Fund Path

* **Role Advancement:** After \~1–2 years in a quant developer or engineer role, aim to transition toward **Quant Strategist** or **Quant Researcher** positions. This may involve working more closely on model development rather than infrastructure. Demonstrate ability by contributing to a profitable strategy or publishing an internal research note.
* **Finance Specialization:** Start thinking like a hedge fund manager. Consider certification like **CFA (Levels II/III)** if going to portfolio management, or **CQF (Certificate in Quantitative Finance)** for technical credibility. Read hedge fund literature and keep abreast of markets daily.
* **Long-Term Education (Optional):** If not already done, a **top-tier PhD or MFE** (e.g. Princeton/Stanford PhD in CS/Math, or Columbia/Cornell MFE) can accelerate becoming a portfolio manager. Otherwise, strong on-the-job track record and network can substitute.
* **Networking and Branding:** Speak at conferences, publish algorithmic trading blog posts or GitHub demos of complex systems (e.g. latency-optimized data pipelines). This raises profile for hedge fund roles.
* **Aim for Hedge Fund Roles:** Identify hedge funds (AQR, Renaissance, Two Sigma, WorldQuant, DE Shaw, etc.) that hire quantitative analysts or traders. By now, target roles like **Quant Researcher** or **Portfolio Analyst**. Use both direct applications and recruiters specializing in finance.
